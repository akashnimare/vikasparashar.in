# Hi, I'm Vikas
I'm a web developer living in Surat, India. I design, build, and ship software that helps people.

I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of web development from back end programming (Django/Python, Node) to front end engineering (HTML5, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript), user experience and visual design.

I'm an undergraduate at the National Institute of Technology Surat, India studying Applied Physics. Here's my [resume](http://vikasparashar.in/vikas-parashar-resume.pdf).
